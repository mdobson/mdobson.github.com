title: FizzBuzz, Siren, and Hypermedia
---

Recently I've been doing quite a bit of work with [Siren Hypermedia](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren) APIs. I've been working through implementing a client in Objective-C for interacting with that particular media type, and a good gut check was to use FizzBuzz as a Service by Stephen Mizell. Here are a couple screenshots of the app.

It's a very simple and straight forward app. It uses [SHMKit](https://github.com/mdobson/SHMKit)
