title: My First Startup Failed
---

I recently shuttered Studycache. My medical research startup that I have been working on the past two years. After only a small amount of adoption, and a myriad of other things I've found that it's best to not continue on the product. After much reflection it came down to a list of factors that contributed to my failure.

1. **I failed** to focus on the product
2. **I failed** to be assertive
3. **I failed** to be honest with my Co-Founder

####Product
The first point of my failure was little focus on the product. I'm a technical person by trade, and I focused far too long on good code and cool frameworks. This drove decisions based more on cool tools than getting a job done. In the end the product suffered. Tools are good to focus on, but are only a means to an end. It's still on the developer to create something great.

####Assertiveness
The second point of my failure was lack of assertiveness to go and market my product and show others. I tend to be a very private person that has a hard time showing off accomplishments. This came to be a shortcoming when trying to build something and show it off. Eventually you need to convince people that your product is worthwhile and that they should pay for it.

####Honesty
The last part of my failure was not being 100% honest with my Co-Founder. We had some reservations during this whole process on who to talk to and when. We had different opinions, and me sugar coating what I was trying to get across didn't help. Speaking honestly with people who are on your team is paramount to sucess. Without that layer of honesty things will fall apart.

####Postmortem

I still firmly believe that creating a product to make academic, scientific, and medical research practices more modern is important. At least for now I'm not going to be the person doing it. However, I learned a ton from my small startup and it serves me well after all this time. It hasn't deterred me from the dream of running my own company and being a leader. In fact it has driven me even more to keep building things and coming up with ideas to create.
