<h1>Hello, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/mdobs/">@mdobs</a>.</h1>
<br/>
<p>I currently reside in the City of Detroit. I help organize multiple events around the city like Detroit Startup Drinks and <a href="http://painpitch.org/">Pain Pitch</a>. Creating things with others is something I'm deeply passionate about.</p>
<p> I'm interested in creating interfaces for everything in the world so everyday objects can communicate with each other. I'm fluent in multiple technologies and paradigms. I try to deal in open source software as much as possible. Giving back by creating some value for the open source community is something that is incredibly important to me. Reach out to me for specfics.</p>
<p>These are assorted essays about my thoughts on multiple subjects. Mostly technology.</p>
